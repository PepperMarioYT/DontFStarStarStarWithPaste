# Don't mess with copy and paste

## Background

It annoys me to no end when a web application prevents me from being able to
paste content into an input field, or copy it out.  If I paste an incorrect
email address, that's my own fault.  I use tools like 1Password to
remember all kinds of things for me, and it's actually more error prone for me
to type out all the characters than it is for me to copy from 1Password and
paste into a text box.

## Solution

This is a dead simple Google Chrome extension that removes copy and paste
blocking.
